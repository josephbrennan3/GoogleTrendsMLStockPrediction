# GoogleTrendsMLStockPrediction
The purpose of this paper is to investigate the recent phenomena of applying internet search queries to stock market predictions, alongside further analysis of traditional machine learning (ML) regression algorithms. The algorithms examined for this paper are an ensemble learning method and supervised learning model, Random Forest regression and Support Vector Regression (SVR) respectively. Ten FTSE 100 companies were se- lected for this study to perform next day closing price prediction. Google Trends measured daily search volume for the company name plus five keywords associated, daily historic stock data was also examined for technical analysis, over a four-year period. Results for this paper found that all three of the SVR kernels performed poorly when predicting next day stock prices, proving to be statistically insignificant, with high RMSE and MAE scores. Results for Random Forest proved to be statistically significant following on from previous studies that found the algorithm to perform strongly as a next day price predictor, with low RMSE and MAE scores. Google Trends did not significantly improve price prediction on the baseline Random Forest model unlike recent literature.
